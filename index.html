        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4"> As of now, I am currently a student at the University of California, Riverside. My academic interests lie in the world of marketing and finance. So far, my love for business is growing as I took a course outlining the different types of business methods at my university. For example, I learned how marketing influences consumer behavior, and how we can apply those skills to persuade others. My prior experiences lie in the world of real estate. As an intern for an agent, I did different open houses that allowed me to increase my public speaking skills. In addition, I also learned how to manage my time efficiently in order to complete demanding tasks required of me.  
        <br> Outside of the university, my love for the stock market grew when I was 13, which reinforced my decision to join business. My first investment was a small sum of fifty dollars that was quickly able to grow into $500. As a frequent investor, I have learned to make quick thinking decisions that can help me out in the future. My proudest achievement was increasing my portfolio drastically by over 200% in a span of two months. Thus, my love for finance became apparent as I realized the strength I had when it came to numbers. 
        <br> For my future, I plan on getting as many internships as I can. I would like to obtain as much knowledge as I can either for finance or for marketing in order to be successful later on. In addition, I'm trying to join certain clubs that will help me gain experience and get me connected as alumni as well.
        <br> My interests outside of the academic field vary from sports to more leisurely activities such as reading. As a basketball fanatic, you can expect to find me in the court shooting hoops or simply watching a game at my university. In addition to sports, I love music. Don't be surprised if you find me at your local music store trying to play a new instrument or testing out the newest model of a guitar. My love for reading made me realize the importance of education, which in return made me pursue getting a college degree. Some hopes I have for the future are to work in one of the big four companies, but at the same time be able to travel the world.
        <br> Last but not least, I love giving back as much as I can to my community. This passion for helping others led me to help form an organization in my high school that helped homeless pets. I was also a frequent marcher for the women's march, since I believe that equality is a must in this society. Furthermore, I try to get involved as much as I can in politics. In the end, I helped Michael Bloomberg, a democratic candidate, run his campaign in 2020. Finally, another favorite volunteering activity of mine is planting trees in my local park, or helping weed out nature parks that need to be tended.
